# Home-Automation
**ABSTRACT**

 The concept of this is making our daily chores easier by using the technology. Our project is about controlling the home appliances in a smart way by using our phones to control the devices. This device makes the working and controlling of the home devices in  more efficient way. This device manages the power consumption of the appliances. 
 
 **INTRODUCTION**
 
 Home automation is building automation for a home. A home automation system will monitor and control home attributes such as lighting, entertainment systems, and appliances.
It also includes home security such as access control and alarm systems. Home devices are an important constituent of the Internet of Things.
Such systems depend on the collection of data. The data is then used for monitoring, controlling and transferring information to other devices via the internet. This allows specific actions to be automatically activated whenever certain situations arise.
Now apply the same concept to the entire home and all the devices present. That is a smart home powered by IoT. Instead of manually going up to the device and taking action, those actions can be taken at the press of a button. These days, most smart IoT home automation devices allow you to control them via an app or even via voice commands.
